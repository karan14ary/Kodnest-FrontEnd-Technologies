<h3>History :</h3>
<p>
<pre>
    The history of Java is very interesting. Java was originally designed for interactive television,
    but it was too advanced technology for the digital cable television industry at the time.
    The history of Java starts with the Green Team.
    Java team members (also known as Green Team), initiated this project to develop a language for
    digital devices such as set-top boxes, televisions, etc. 
    However, it was best suited for internet programming. Later, Java technology was incorporated by Netscape.

    The principles for creating Java programming were "Simple, Robust, Portable, Platform-independent, Secured,
    High Performance, Multithreaded, Architecture Neutral, Object-Oriented, Interpreted, and Dynamic". 
    Java was developed by James Gosling, who is known as the father of Java, in 1995. 
    James Gosling and his team members started the project in the early '90s.

    <pre>
        The primary objective of Java programming language creation was to make it portable, 
        simple and secure programming language. Apart from this, there are also some excellent 
        features which play an important role in the popularity of this language. 
        The features of Java are also known as Java buzzwords.
        A list of the most important features of the Java language is given below.
