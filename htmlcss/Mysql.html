    <h3>History :</h3>
    <p>
        <pre>
            MySQL was created by a Swedish company, MySQL AB, founded by Swedes David Axmark, Allan Larsson
            and Finnish Michael "Monty" Widenius. Original development of MySQL by Widenius and Axmark began
            in 1994.The first version of MySQL appeared on 23 May 1995. It was initially created for
            personal usage from mSQL based on the low-level language ISAM, which the creators considered 
            too slow and inflexible. They created a new SQL interface, while keeping the same API as mSQL. 
            By keeping the API consistent with the mSQL system, many developers were able to use MySQL instead
            of the (proprietarily licensed) mSQL antecedent.

    <h3>Features :</h3>
    <p>
        
            The following features of Structured Query Language make it a solid primary but robust language for lots of organizations looking to manage their large databases:
        <ul>
            <li>Flexibility and Scalability</li> 
            SQL offers users flexibility and scalability for relational database management systems. 
            With SQL, it is easier to create new tables while dropping or deleting previously-created or scantily used tables.

            <li>A Comprehensive Application Development Tool</li> 
            Programmers use SQL to program applications to access a database, making it a comprehensive and effective 
            application development tool. SQL is suitable for every large or small organization, no matter the size.

            <li> Rich Transactional Support</li>
            It has rich transactional support. Structured Query Language’s programming capability of handling 
            large records while also managing several other transactions is top-notch.

            <li>High Performance</li> 
            Another feature of SQL is that it offers a high-performance programming capability for high usage, 
            incredibly transactional, and heavy workload database systems. Structured Query Language’s programming 
            provides different ways to describe data more analytically.

            <li> High Availability</li>
            SQL is compatible with other databases such as Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle Database, MS Access, MySQL, SAP 
            Adaptive Server, and more.
            These RDBMSs support SQL, and it is easier to create application extensions for procedural programming and 
            several other SQL functions that are extra features, hence making SQL a strong tool.

            <li>High Security</li> 
            SQL also has high security as one of its notable features. It’s easy to give permissions on views, 
            procedures, and tables. So with SQL, you get optimum security for your data.

            <li> SQL’s Management Ease</li>
            Almost every Relational Database Management System uses Structured Query Language. Some of the common and 
            standard SQL commands include “Delete,” “Insert,” “Select,” “Update,” and “Drop.” These commands help users manage large amounts of data from a database efficiently and quickly.

            <li>Open Source</li> 
            Structured Query Language has the feature of being an open-source programming language great for building
            relational database management systems (RDBMS). This makes it a great pick for developers and programmers 
            who are looking for a community of professionals to learn from off, and it’s also one of the benefits of SQL.
